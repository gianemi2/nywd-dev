              <p>
                For the past two decades, we have committed ourselves to building trust with our clients and vendors,
                cultivating business relationships that are rooted in integrity and transparency. At each stage of the
                partnership, our team is devoted to your success. <br /><br />

                We work closely with you to understand the unique needs of your company, conducting thorough research
                into your brand’s architecture and securing strong partnerships with our clients worldwide. Above all,
                we respect the discretion of our vendors by strictly adhering to their licensing policies. Our business
                model allows you to serve all of your consumer segments while simultaneously bringing you a seamless
                end-to-end customer experience. <br /><br />

                The <b>NYWD</b> business model is designed to offer our clients the most convenient and timely ordering
                process in the industry. Rather than operating on a pre-order system, our custom-built B2B platform
                offers a wide range of inventory that is available at-once, with most orders shipping within a 24 to
                48-hour window.
