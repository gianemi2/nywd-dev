                  <b>Eco-friendly materials</b> <br /><br />
                  Eco-friendly materials are trending as buyers the world over become more environmentally conscious.
                  Eyewear manufacturers and top designers are evolving, both in terms of fashion and the technological
                  advances in materials used for assembly. Sunglasses and eyeglasses made from titanium and eco-friendly
                  plastics can offer a comfortable and durable fit. In line with greater environmental awareness,
                  eco-conscious materials are increasingly in demand.

                <p class="line-height-body">
                  <b>Titanium</b> <br /><br />
                  Titanium is a popular material appearing in a variety of eyewear shapes this year, including oversized
                  1970s styles and big round frames. As a metal, titanium has many industrial applications, such as
                  aviation and construction. It’s renowned for its high strength-to-weight ratio and resistance to
                  corrosion. In eyewear, this means durable, lightweight frames that have a thinner silhouette and more
                  flexibility than those made from steel or aluminum – perfect for reading glasses too. Titanium is also
                  skin-friendly and doesn’t cause any allergic reactions.

                <p class="line-height-body">
                  <b>Natural wood and cork</b> <br /><br />
                  Natural wood and cork are increasingly appearing in luxury sunglasses and eyeglass frames in many
                  designer eyewear collections. Classic eyewear made from wood and cork have been around for several
                  years, and are a great option for a bold look. Often used for square frames and larger, rounder
                  styles, these materials make a unique statement and offer a wide range of color options.

                <p class="line-height-body">
                  <b>Bio-acetate</b> <br /><br />
                  Bio-acetate is another eco-friendly choice, created from sustainable sources and often biodegradable
                  and recyclable. Bio-acetate is particularly suitable for semi-transparent frames in timeless shapes,
                  including cat-eye frames or modern wayfarer sunglass styles.

                  Aviator style sunglasses have never gone out of style. The original style from the 1950s has been one
                  of the top choices for both men and women for nearly 80 years. If you want a clean, classic look that
                  means business, this frame could be the right choice for daily wear to work and casual outings.</p>

                  <b>Oversized, square and oval shapes </b><br /><br />
                  Oversized, square and oval shapes seem to be gaining traction in the eyewear designer world. Initially
                  we only saw sunglasses in such shapes, but now more and more we see them used for prescription eyewear
                  frames. The style originated in the 1970s and now there are a flurry of top designer eyewear
                  manufacturers producing rx-able frames in these styles, guaranteed to draw attention for their fun and
                  stylish feel. <br /><br />
                  <b>Color </b><br /><br />
                  Color is also trending. More and more people are expressing themselves with fun and flashy colors,
                  especially for the spring and summer seasons. As we head into summer, red, white, beige, peach and
                  teal are trending in both solid plastics and transparent materials. Lighter colors are more suitable
                  for the spring and summer seasons, while darker colors seem to dominate in fall and winter.
